# Abstract
Content in undergraduate biology courses, including animal behavior courses, has been historically hetero and cis-normative due to various cultural stigmas, biases, and discrimination. Such curricular content may be partially responsible for why LGBTQ+ students in biology have a lower sense of belonging than their peers. As such, we developed six activities that aimed to expand the representation of marginalized perspectives in the curriculum of an online undergraduate animal behavior course, with a specific focus on topics relating to sex, gender, and sexuality. We assessed the impact of the revisions on student perceptions of concepts in the field of animal behavior and on students’ sense of belonging using a pre and post survey in both an unrevised and revised version of the course. We found that when compared to their non-LGBTQ+ peers, LGBTQ+ students enter the course with a lower sense of belonging in the field of biology, but a better understanding of many concepts in the field of animal behavior that are influenced by cultural biases associated with sex, gender, and sexuality. We also found that our revisions improved the sense of belonging in the field of biology for LGBTQ+ undergraduates. Our revisions improved student comprehension of many animal behavior concepts of interest, such as the prevalence and importance of homosexuality in many animal species. We demonstrate the importance of highlighting marginalized perspectives in undergraduate biology curricula for undergraduate experiences, and we emphasize the role of early career scientists in curriculum development.
